# ppt_recorder

This python script allows to make sceenshots and save them to a give folder.

## My Usecase:
I have many meetings during a workday and it is not always clear, if the presentation will be shared afterwards.
So, I want to make screenshots during the presentation using a keyboards-shortcut and save the pictures into
a selected folder.

So far I have tested the script on Mac OS 13.1 - Ventura. Soon I will test on Windows 10.
